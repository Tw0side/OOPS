The repository is made for KTU S3 CYBER AND CSE STUDENTS OF THE 2019 SCHEME for the OOPS LAB.
The Repo consists of programs which are ready to run out of the box..enabling students to find out errors in their code.
Its advised not to blindly copy paste this programs but rather understand what a specific Line of code does.
HAPPY CODING

THE FOLLWING PROGRAMS HAS BEEN UPDATED IN THIS REPO..

1]Frequency count

    Aim:To find the count of a specific character in a string.

2]Matrix multipication

    Aim:To implement Matrix multiplication in JAVA

3]Inheritance

    Aim:To implement Inheritence property of OOPs

4]Polymorphism

    Aim-Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ).
Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape.
Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.

5]Method Overloading

    Aim-Write a Java program to calculate the area of different shapes namely circle, rectangle, and triangle using the concept of method overloading.

6]File handling

    Aim- Write a Java program that reads a file and displays the file on the screen.

7]File read and write

    Aim-Write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer.

8]File read - write with exception.

Aim-Write a Java program that read from a file and write to file by handling all file related exceptions

9]File handling( for counting characters, words, lines)---In program(FileContent.java).

Aim-Write a Java program that displays the number of characters, lines and words in a text file.

10]String Tokenizer

Aim-Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).

11]Try, catch, throws, finally

Aim - Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, throws and finally.

12]MultiThreading

Aim-Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads.
First thread generates a random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, the second thread computes the square of the number and prints.
If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of the cube of the number.

13]Thread Synchrnization

Aim-Write a Java program that shows thread synchronization.

14].Calculator using GUI

Aim-Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator.
Arrange Buttons for digits and the + - * % operations properly.
Add a text field to display the result.
Handle any possible exceptions like divide by zero.
Use Java Swing

15]Traffic lights using GUI

Aim-Write a Java program that simulates a traffic light.
The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green.
When a radio button is selected, the light is turned on, and only one light can be on at a time.


These are the programs meant for Fair Record For the 2022-2026 s3 batch.
Happy coding...
